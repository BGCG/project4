### Strategy plane

With UX principles in mind, I wanted to address what target audience the site would serve, what are their goals and what are their concerns. With this in mind, I found that I wanted to create a vegan recipe site that was all inclusive and also had varying difficulties to cater to people of all cooking confidences. I also wanted to create a community recipes site to address the lack of support an individual can sometimes feel when they are switching to a complete or partial plant-based diet.

## Target audience

* Anyone who would like to convert partially or completely to a plant-based diet
* Is open to sharing their own recipes
* Is open to interacting with others on the site via comments

## Site goals 

* To provide a wide range of plant-based recipes
* To provide a community platform where users can interact through commenting on recipes and joining the social media groups
* To provide a platform for food influencers to share their recipes and promote their following on other platforms

### New user goals

* To browse the site for vegan recipes
* To register to the site to post own recipes
* To interact with other members through commenting of recipes
* To connect to the Vegan Vivera social media groups

### Current user goals

* To browse the site for newly posted vegan recipes
* To post own recipes
* To interact with other members through commenting of recipes
* To provide a platform to share their own recipes and build there account (note: this could be particularly useful for Food influencers)

### Superuser goals

* To be able to post recipes from the Admin team
* To be able to moderate post content
* To be able to moderate comments
* To filter through recipes and comments to ensure can ease the process of moderating site
