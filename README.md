### Strategy plane

With UX principles in mind, I wanted to address what target audience the site would serve, what are their goals and what are their concerns. With this in mind, I found that I wanted to create a vegan recipe site that was all inclusive and also had varying difficulties to cater to people of all cooking confidences. I also wanted to create a community recipes site to address the lack of support an individual can sometimes feel when they are switching to a complete or partial plant-based diet.

## Target audience

* Anyone who would like to convert partially or completely to a plant-based diet
* Is open to sharing their own recipes
* Is open to interacting with others on the site via comments

## Site goals 

* To provide a wide range of plant-based recipes
* To provide a community platform where users can interact through commenting on recipes and joining the social media groups
* To provide a platform for food influencers to share their recipes and promote their following on other platforms

### New user goals

* To browse the site for vegan recipes
* To register to the site to post own recipes
* To interact with other members through commenting of recipes
* To connect to the Vegan Vivera social media groups

### Current user goals

* To browse the site for newly posted vegan recipes
* To post own recipes
* To interact with other members through commenting of recipes
* To provide a platform to share their own recipes and build there account (note: this could be particularly useful for Food influencers)

### Superuser goals

* To be able to post recipes from the Admin team
* To be able to moderate post content
* To be able to moderate comments
* To filter through recipes and comments to ensure can ease the process of moderating site

### Design

#### Logo

The logo displays the name of the site in Caveat, which is a handwriting family provided by Google Fonts. It has a very organic look to represent the leaves of certain vegetables or sprouts from a plant. The font is coloured in green to further add to this organic theme.

#### Imagery

The imagery is all of different dishes where I selected those that displayed bursts of color as I wanted to create a contrast with the white background of the body of the site.

#### Colour scheme

The colour scheme represents the greenness of certain fruits and vegetables, while also sporting some bursts of colors (such as various shades of oranges, reds, pink) from the imagery used in the site, all contrasting with the white background of the site. 

### Agile epics

#### **Completed user stories**

The project was planned and carried out using the Agile methodology, making use of the GitHub Kanban boards. 

User stories were separated into MUST HAVE, SHOULD HAVE, COULD HAVE AND SHOULDN'T HAVE.

The epics were categorised in a number of different milestones - Account, Admin, Browsing, Content observation, Content creation, Content reaction.

The full Kanban board can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/BGCG/projects/6/views/1)

In the Kanban board the user stories were divided into three sections
* No status
* To do 
* In progress 
* Done

The list of completed epics in their milestones categories are below - 

Epic | ADMIN 

* As a site admin I can moderate user comments so that I can remove any inappropriate comments (MUST HAVE)
* As a site admin I can approve or disapprove recipe posts so I can manage inappropriate content (MUST HAVE)
* As a site admin I can create, update and delete posts so that I can manage all the blog content (MUST HAVE)

Epic | ACCOUNT 

* As a site user I can login or logout of my account so that I can post recipes and react to content (MUST HAVE)
* As a site user I can set up an account so that they can like/unlike and comment on posts (MUST HAVE)

Epic | BROWSING 

* As a site user I can favourite a recipe so that I can save my favourite recipes to revisit later (MUST HAVE)

Epic | CONTENT REACTION 

* As a site user who is registered I can comment on a recipe post so that I can participate in the conversation (MUST HAVE)
* As a site user I can like/unlike recipe posts so that I can react to content (MUST HAVE)

Epic | CONTENT OBSERVATION 

* As a site user I can view how many favourites a recipe has so I can see which is the most popular (MUST HAVE)
* As a site user I can view comments so that I can observe the conversation (MUST HAVE)
* As a site user I can view number of likes on each recipe so that I can see which recipe is the most popular (MUST HAVE)
* As a site user I can open a recipe post so that I can read the recipe post (MUST HAVE)
* As a site user I can view a list of recipe posts so that I can select which one I want to read (MUST HAVE)

Epics | CONTENT CREATION 

* As a site user I can view my own post list so that I can easily access my own posts and edit them if I want (SHOULD HAVE)
* As a site admin/site user I can create drafts of recipe posts so that I can finish writing a post later (MUST HAVE)
* As a site user I can create, update and delete recipe my posts so that I can control the recipe blog content that I have posted (MUST HAVE)

#### **Uncompleted epics**

There were a few epics I did not complete. I have provided details of these and reasons for not completing them below

Epic | BROWSING 
* As a site user I can search the recipes on the site so that I can easily navigate to recipes I want to view (COULD HAVE)

Epic | ACCOUNT 
* As a registered site user I can create a user profile page so I can build a public profile to connect better with other users (COULD HAVE)

Reason for non-completion of both above epics: Time constraints

Epic | CONTENT REACTION 
* As a site user I can update and delete my own comments so I can manage my own comments if I'm not happy with them (SHOULDN'T HAVE)

Reason for non-completion: In the project inception, I thought the ability for users to have more control over their comment reactions might be a good feature for user experience. However, when inserting this epic into the Kanban board I realised that the ability of users to delete comments might disrupt the flow of the conversation so I decided it shouldn't be implemented.
