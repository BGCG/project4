# VeggieBytes

### Background

Curiosity in Veganism is on the rise. Google trends analysis has suggested an increase in the searching of the term 'Veganism' from the years 2004 and 2022, with the top countries for searches including Israel, Australia, UK, Australia and New Zealand (Google Trends). Based on a poll analysis, the number of vegans in the UK quadrupled between 2014 and 2018, from 150,000 and 600,000 people (Economist, 2020). Furthermore, the number of US consumers who identify with eating a vegan diet has increased from 1% to 6% between 2014 and 2017 (Forbes, 2018).

This rise in interest in veganism and plant-based diets has not gone unnoticed by big business, with many supermarkets and fast-food chains offering vegan options as they cater to a new consumer base. The global Vegan food industry grew from $14.44 to $15.77 billion in 2020 compared to 2021 and there is projected growth over the next several years (Sentient media, 2022).

Even though there has been an increased interest in veganism and plant-based diets, there are still certain perceptions around veganism. A qualitative based survey analysis has suggested that a subset of non-vegan participants think that there is a low variety of vegan food available and veganism is 'too difficult'. That said, other non-vegan participants suggested that one of the reasons that attracts them to veganism is feeling a part of a community (Souza et al. 2020).

VeggieBytes aims to tackle the growing interest in veganism and plant-based diets by offering an online platform for users who are curious about a plant-based diet, have a partial plant-based diet or a complete plant-based diet to share recipes of varying difficulty levels and connect through commenting and recipe sharing.

### Site purpose

VeggieBytes is a plant-based recipe sharing site which aims to connect users through sharing recipes, commenting and connecting to the VeggieBytes social media groups. It aims to provide recipes of varying difficulty levels to cater those for all cooking confidence levels. 

VeggieBytes is hosted on Heroku and can be accessed [here](https://vegan-recipe-app.herokuapp.com/). This project was created for the purpose of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Diploma portfolio 4 project submission.

### Design

#### Logo and font

The logo displays the name of the site in Caveat, which is a handwriting family provided by Google Fonts. It has a very organic look to represent the leaves of certain vegetables or sprouts from a plant. The font is coloured in green to further add to this organic theme. The logo contrasts with the serif font EB Garamond from Google Fonts, which is used for the body text.

#### Imagery

The imagery is all of different dishes where I selected those that displayed bursts of color as I wanted to create a contrast with the white background of the body of the site.

#### Colour scheme

The colour scheme represents the greenness of certain fruits and vegetables, while also sporting some bursts of colors (such as various shades of oranges, reds, pink) from the imagery used in the site, all contrasting with the white background of the site. 

### Agile epics

#### **Completed user stories**

The project was planned and carried out using the Agile methodology, making use of the GitHub Kanban boards. 

User stories were separated into MUST HAVE, SHOULD HAVE, COULD HAVE AND SHOULDN'T HAVE.

The epics were categorised in a number of different milestones - Account, Admin, Browsing, Content observation, Content creation, Content reaction.

The full Kanban board can be viewed [here](https://github.com/users/BGCG/projects/6/views/1)

In the Kanban board the user stories were divided into three sections
* No status
* To do 
* In progress 
* Done

The list of completed epics in their milestones categories are below - 

Epic | ADMIN 

* As a site admin I can moderate user comments so that I can remove any inappropriate comments (MUST HAVE)
* As a site admin I can approve or disapprove recipe posts so I can manage inappropriate content (MUST HAVE)
* As a site admin I can create, update and delete posts so that I can manage all the blog content (MUST HAVE)

Epic | ACCOUNT 

* As a site user I can login or logout of my account so that I can post recipes and react to content (MUST HAVE)
* As a site user I can set up an account so that they can like/unlike and comment on posts (MUST HAVE)

Epic | BROWSING 

* As a site user I can favourite a recipe so that I can save my favourite recipes to revisit later (MUST HAVE)

Epic | CONTENT REACTION 

* As a site user who is registered I can comment on a recipe post so that I can participate in the conversation (MUST HAVE)
* As a site user I can like/unlike recipe posts so that I can react to content (MUST HAVE)
* As a site user I can contact admin via a contact form so communicate with admin in case I have any issues with my account or the site or any suggestions for the site content (SHOULD HAVE)

Epic | CONTENT OBSERVATION 

* As a site user I can view how many favourites a recipe has so I can see which is the most popular (MUST HAVE)
* As a site user I can view comments so that I can observe the conversation (MUST HAVE)
* As a site user I can view number of likes on each recipe so that I can see which recipe is the most popular (MUST HAVE)
* As a site user I can open a recipe post so that I can read the recipe post (MUST HAVE)
* As a site user I can view a list of recipe posts so that I can select which one I want to read (MUST HAVE)
* As a site user I can favourite/unfavourite a recipe post so that I can add or remove that post from my favourites list

Epics | CONTENT CREATION 

* As a site user I can view my own post list so that I can easily access my own posts and edit them if I want (SHOULD HAVE)
* As a site admin/site user I can create drafts of recipe posts so that I can finish writing a post later (MUST HAVE)
* As a site user I can create, update and delete recipe my posts so that I can control the recipe blog content that I have posted (MUST HAVE)

#### **Uncompleted epics**

There were a few epics I did not complete. I have provided details of these and reasons for not completing them below

Epic | BROWSING 
* As a site user I can search the recipes on the site so that I can easily navigate to recipes I want to view (COULD HAVE)

Epic | ACCOUNT 
* As a registered site user I can create a user profile page so I can build a public profile to connect better with other users (COULD HAVE)

Reason for non-completion of both above epics: Time constraints

Epic | CONTENT REACTION 
* As a site user I can update and delete my own comments so I can manage my own comments if I'm not happy with them (SHOULDN'T HAVE)

Reason for non-completion: In the project inception, I thought the ability for users to have more control over their comment reactions might be a good feature for user experience. However, when inserting this user story into the Kanban board I realised that the ability of users to delete comments might disrupt the flow of the conversation so I decided it shouldn't be implemented.

### Credits

#### Code

I found the [Bootstrap 4 documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/getting-started/introduction/) particularly helpful with creation of the recipe cards. Additionally, I utilised the Bootstrap 4 dropdown navbar code. 

In the image upload on the user post form, I found the following [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_form_enctype.asp) and the [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/django_image_and_video_upload) documentation helpful in achieving this which suggested include the `enctype` attribute set to `"multipart/form-data"` in the form element to specify that the form is recieving multiple types of data. 

The Code Institute course materials including 'Hello Django' and 'I Think therefore I Blog' for guidelines in setting up and deploying the django app, as well as implementing the CRUD functionality. 

For the messages functionality, the 'I think therefore I blog' Code Institute tutorial helpful in setting this up, but when following the tutorial exactly for some reason the close icon on the alert wasn't functional. I found changing `data-db-dismiss` to `data-dismiss` as per this [stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75037418/bootstrap-4-close-button-not-working-django) resolve this issue.

Addition of the favicon was assisted by following the [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_favicon.asp) guide.

I have provided further credits in the troubleshooting section.

### Troubleshooting

I had issue with allowing the form to accept image uploads, after searching online I found a number of resources suggesting that need to 1. specify how the form data should be encoded when sent to the server by including the `enctype` attribute set to `"multipart/form-data"` in the form element and 2. I need to intialise the form object with both the uploaded files and the form data `PostForm(request.POST, request.FILES)`. I found the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/http/file-uploads/) particularly helpful in me achieving amoungst other resources stated in the credits section.

On the topic of images, I had issues with the card images on the homepage, all recipes and favourite list pages slowing down the performance (as determined by the Lighthouse report) due to 'Explicitly set width and height of images' and 'set images to next gen formats'. I decided to make full use of the Cloudinary image hosting service and all it's available image transformations. By following Cloudinarys guide on [Python image transformations](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/django_image_manipulation), where I used the Cloudinary template tags to embed the images as so - `{% cloudinary recipe.recipe_image.url quality="auto:low" width="100%" height="100%" crop="scale" alt="custom recipe image" %}`. This allowed me to set parameters for cropping, width, height and quality where Cloudinary will perform these transformations on the fly, which vastly improved the performance. Furthermore, ensuring all default recipe images and decorative images on the site, as well as adjusting the size of the default recipe image to what is required (as we don't require a large image size for a card image) greatly increased the performance.

One instance I experienced an issue when creating the ContactRequest model, where I wanted to add a first name and last name field to the contact form but when I added it I keep on getting an error when trying to apply the migrations `You are trying to add a non-nullable field`. I believe what happened was there was already contact requests in the database that did not have first name or last name fields which could not be blank, therefore this would an integrity error. Therefore, I had a look online how to resolve this as even when I commented out the model or set a default value and tried to update the migrations, I was still getting the same error. I found a [post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-do-i-reset-django-migration-nitin-raturi/?trk=pulse-article_more-articles_related-content-card) which suggested that you can drop the whole database and start again. This seemed like quite an extreme measure so I felt uncomfortable doing this, therefore I contacted Tutor support to see if they could help me find an alternative solution. Sean from Tutor support dropped the table from the ContectRequest model which resolved the issue.
